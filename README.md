## Prediction of employee's salary.

### Here the dataset contains two columns. first column is years of experience and second column is the actual salary based on years of experience. I have implemented this Machine Learning model by two ways, 1: Using Sklearn library and 2: Without using Sklearn library. I have uploaded corresponding plotting figures in the sub files.

## Without using Sklearn:

### Cost vs Iterations:
### In order to check whether the cost function is decreasing or not.
