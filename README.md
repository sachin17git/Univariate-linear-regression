# Univariate-linear-regression

## Prediction of employee's salary.

### Here the dataset contains two columns. first column is years of experience and second column is the actual salary based on years of experience. I have implemented this model by using Sklearn and without using Sklearn library. I have uploaded corresponding plotting figures in the sub files.
